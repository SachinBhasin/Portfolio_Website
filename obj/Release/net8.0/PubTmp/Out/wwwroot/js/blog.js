                    <p>The start of a new year has always been something big to talk about on social media. "Time to reset that sleep schedule" or "Time to lock in on those big targets" but they seemingly always fall through the cracks too early in the year because of the failure to have the right foundations beneath them so that they can accomplish those particular goals. Whilst I am certainly not an expert on getting everything right, I definitely know that a building cannot be constructed to reach the sky without a solid foundation to hold up that growth. What I'm saying is that I need to make sure I stick with what I know and what's logical. So what foundations do I have to rely on or that I need to work on to improve before I start to get after my big goals?</p>
                    <p>I know from university and from school before that, working on the foundations is important but let's highlight what I have in mind as my end goal. In an ideal and perfect world, I'd be taking nature and motorsport photography and selling them like hotcakes to the public. Definitely living in Scotland and I honestly do want to own a horse because I'd be able to. But we're not in an ideal world unfortunately but I can build my own world with everything I want or desire in it as best as I can with what time I have. In a way, I've now highlighted what I want as my end goals, so let's break it down to what needs to be done to get to that final position.</p>
                    <p>Firstly, there is no point in dreaming about selling my work to anyone in the public if I don't have a shop going already. Thankfully I have a shop already but I've never had the guts to post my photos on there. It was never a matter of "I don't think I can do it" but more that I thought I'd do it too well and I wasn't sure what my next step was. Basically overthinking my steps and thinking that I always had to be several steps ahead when I try something. 2025 has proven to me that you can never anticipate what's going to happen and I'll go more into my reflection of 2025 in another post. So what's the first step? I've been asking myself this for the past month since first creating this website and it's quite simply to finally put up some photos in the shop for people to purchase. From there, I can receive feedback on my shop, my work and my prices. Only from failure will I learn how to do it the right way.</p>
                    <p>The next stage in this journey would have to be networking. Talking to strangers became less of a problem for me since attending and completing university and I can be thankful to say that I did that on my own, there was no alcohol required to gain that confidence. Seems to be a trend in movies or films where a swig of alcohol, or liquid courage as it's sometimes portrayed, and BOOM, you can do anything. But it was never like that, I just had to think and understand that there may be others with anxiety like me and I can help them talk by opening up the conversation. All I simply had to do was put aside my fears and start a conversation, and most students at the time that I knew all played video games so it's not like it was really that hard to think of something. I honestly don't remember what games were coming out in Sept 2019 but there were still plenty to talk about for me to be able to start several conversations during many nights out. But back to the point at hand. Talking to strangers links to networking because I need to know how to start a conversation with people I've never met before in an industry that I have a profound passion and love for whilst avoiding the impression that I'm not just a kid who loves cars going vroom really loudly. I do have that really strong passion and love for the sport, and that's what I need to use to my advantage to talk to the teams and learn or get to know them.</p>
                    <p>Over the two days spent with friends at Silverstone in 2024 for the British GT series, I actually managed to learn more about myself than I did about them because I suddenly realised that I had the confidence. So I quietly dared myself to push a little further and that gave me the opportunity of a lifetime... which I proceeded to fumble immediately, but I still learnt some great things. The story goes that in a conversation with an engineer, someone else approached me to ask who I was just as the conversation started. Shifting my attention to the gentleman, I realised he'd just told me that his son owns the team and he asked me if I wanted to try to sneak into the garage where the drivers were. Of course I was going to leap at the chance to do that and after being dragged quickly into the main part of the garage, I found myself within a few feet of the team's driver checking the timings board. That wasn't just any driver, THE Jessica Hawkins was standing right in front of me. She is a British professional racing driver and an ambassador for the Aston Martin Formula One Team. Sadly, whilst this was awesome and all, this is also where I fumbled so badly. Looking through my lens, I was able to see the timing screen through the reflection of her eyes and in the rush to capture the photo, I forgot to change my settings and increase the exposure. So whilst I may have an absolutely incredible story to tell, I have no photos to show for it because of that one simple mistake. But that's where the learning begins and understanding what to do at the next opportunity.</p>

                    <p>2025 has truly been an absolute rollercoaster of a journey from the start of the year through to year end. I'll spare some of the details as they're quite personal but here's the overall story through the months.</p>
                    <p><b>January</b> - 3 years working with someone on a project and after my decision to step down was told, it quickly resulted in a partnership and a friendship burnt to a crisp. After so much time spent to build such a vast project, it was taken so badly when I finally chose to prioritise myself. From that one simple action, it caused other rifts with some of my closest friends to that same person. So whilst the month didn't start well at all for whatever reason, it still ended positively where some of my closest friends kept with me and stood by me when I made a stance for my health. Since then, those friendships have grown evermore and I have been thankful for many of them.</p>
                    <p><b>February</b> - Rocky start considering what happened in the month before, and being approached by someone new with a growing opportunity. I thought that to be more of a redemption chance for me as well as an opportunity to create or grow something that I never had a chance to do before in the old project.</p>
                    <p><b>March</b> - Significant progress made through this new project and a new friend. Not only did I learn more about myself and what I'm capable of but also managed to complete things and host events like never before to a level beyond my comprehension. Always asking questions and always appreciative of the opportunity I chose to accept.</p>
                    <p><b>April</b> - Started as such a joyful month, celebrating a few birthdays and finally booking tickets to some events in May at Silverstone. There really wasn't much going on during the month but things changed after a few messages were received and the news of a friend in hospital was told. Without hesitation, the whole team stepped up and took responsibility over several aspects of the project and we were working so well as a team.</p>
                    <p><b>May</b> - May - Starting the month was tense but after a few short messages, thankful news was heard and relief was felt across the team. Still a busy month with plenty of stress. Thankful for some good news knowing that a friend was on the mend, knowing that they were still kicking brought a wave of relief over the team but that didn't stop us from working tirelessly. Just a few weeks of stress and a LOT of work ahead of ourselves. That work increased when the bot that was designed to help make our lives easier suddenly stopped working and manual work was required. But at the end of the day, or rather the month, things were starting to come back to what used to be normal and we were taking everything day by day.</p>
                    <p><b>June</b> - This is where things got really rocky. In the short span of a month, a family member passed away, another friendship was lost over assumptions and a whole world of stress was caused amidst all the carnage. Not much more to talk about really, but what's important is that I learnt to pick myself back up and I gave myself 50 days to take some time and work out what I want from life and how to build myself up to that position. Without those 50 days, this website would likely have never been something that I wanted to build.</p>
                    <p><b>July</b> - Birthday month started off strong with the welcoming of a good friend to the team as well as everyone working like a well-oiled machine even with the newcomer. I was still employed during this time too and work was going quite well with not much going on. Celebrated my birthday with a delightful breakfast at a French cafe.</p>
                    <p><b>August</b> - The first day of the month was the last day of the week. With the weekend around the corner and a company-wide meeting organised, all the teams were having a laugh and trying to work out the details of the meeting only to be stopped to quieten down till everyone arrives. The news we never expected hit us, redundancy was called out, nearly 80% of the campaign was at risk of redundancy, my team included. Just 10 minutes in and the meeting was called to an end. What a way to start the month. 2 weeks into the month, still trying to understand what I need to focus on for my career assuming I became redundant, and I celebrated my brother's upcoming wedding with his stag weekend. Time spent away as a group of brothers and friends, the weekend being the second most eventful weekend. The weekend immediately after was spent at a car show in Birmingham called Gravity UK with a very close friend. The month wasn't over yet because the weekend after that was spent celebrating another birthday. So from a shocking start to an eventful end for the month.</p>
                    <p><b>September</b> - For the first time this year, it was a month filled with many terrible jokes and hilarious conversations. Some time spent to organise charity events and attend race weekends at Silverstone. But whilst the month was all fun and games, 15th September was the official announcement from work to state who would be made redundant and on what date. They planned a staggered redundancy to help ease the workload reduction carefully. My final date was confirmed. 17th October would be my last day working for the company.</p>
                    <p><b>October</b> - Busy month ahead. The first 2 weeks went by quickly. With a few short goodbyes to the team, I parted ways with them on the Friday and that was that. It was over but the stress didn't stop. Come Monday after that weekend, it was back to work but this time it was any and all final preparations for my brother's big day. The wedding that we celebrated in August with the stag weekend. I think I can honestly say that the weekend went flawlessly, leaving my brother and sister-in-law now finally happily married! With so much energy spent for the wedding weekend, there was little energy left for Halloween so that just turned into Sleep-o-ween for me.</p>
                    <p><b>November</b> - The first full month since the redundancy and I spent it enjoying my time as much as possible. Honestly from playing plenty of games, watching loads of movies and TV shows, catching up on books left unread throughout the year and taking the time to enjoy the freedom that whilst I did not initially want, I'd better enjoy before the next job.</p>
                    <p><b>December</b> - The final month of the year that, at times, felt like it was really flying by too quickly for my liking. From the start of the month to the end, this website was being worked on. Built from the bottom up, countless hours spent to create it and update it with all the information required. That was it though, with Christmas coming up and family time planned for the couple of days, I took charge of the kitchen and chose the set menu for the big day. Recipes all available on my recipes page. From the starters to the dessert, the sauces and all were all prepped by me and cooked by myself and my chosen sous-chef for the day. So much stress on the day but it was all done and served, plenty of laughs and the meal was gone not too long after. Many presents opened and great times spent with family after such a chaotic year. Not long after Christmas comes today.</p>
                    <p>2025 has been a year of absolute chaos but also a year of learning and growth. From losing friendships to gaining new ones, from being made redundant to building my own website, from personal loss to family celebrations, this year has had it all. As I look forward to 2026, I carry with me the lessons learned and the strength gained from overcoming the challenges faced. Here's to a new year filled with hope, growth, and new opportunities.</p>
