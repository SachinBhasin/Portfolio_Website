                <h3 class="timeline-title">The Beginning</h3>
                <p class="timeline-content">Born in the Netherlands, July 2000—the first of three countries I'd call home.</p>

                <h3 class="timeline-title">The First Move</h3>
                <p class="timeline-content">Due to circumstances beyond my comprehension, we moved to a new country. After travelling around 6,000 miles, we settled in Doha, the capital of Qatar. It was a massive change from the Netherlands, not least because of the extreme heat (highs of 50°C in summer), but it was a life-changing experience nonetheless. The memories I made in that desert city will be cherished for life.</p>

                <h3 class="timeline-title">The Second Move</h3>
                <p class="timeline-content">Having just finished the first year of my GCSEs, I was told to prepare for another move—another 6,000 miles, but this time to the UK. So much had to change: selling my belongings and starting over in a place I'd never been. The transition was jarring, but it also felt like a fresh start—one that took me a while to fully accept.</p>

                <p class="timeline-content">Finally, I began my university degree—something many had praised as an experience like no other, where you learn so much valuable information. It was stressful, fun, and full of memories to both keep and forget!</p>

                <p class="timeline-content">
                    I finished my Computer Science degree in 2023, but the graduation ceremony wasn't until 2024. When that day finally
                    came, I walked across the stage while family and friends cheered, collecting that piece of paper confirming I'd done it!

                <p class="timeline-content">And here we are, in the present day. Having recently lost my job to AI, I've had to adapt my skills to the current market. After several conversations, it became clear that a portfolio was the best first step to getting back on my feet doing what I love. So here it is—my website! The start of the next chapter.</p>

                <p class="value-desc">I believe the most meaningful work is honest work. Whether through photography, design, or storytelling, I value truth over perfection and substance over shortcuts. The strongest stories are the ones that are real, intentional, and personal.</p>
